This is a very simple project created to demonstrate using the dpla api for creating a very 
simple portal targeting content about a specific location.  

Want to run it -- just download the files, and set your api_key and location to limit by in the lib/constants.php file (sample of this 
file is in the lib/constants.php.pattern file)
