Search for items about Ohio.  This sample automatically limits all queries to results about content that has been spatially noted as being about Ohio in the metadata.  The example demonstrates how the DPLA and the API could be utilized to create a digital library portal for the State of Ohio, including not just content from Ohio institutions, but all institutions found within the DPLA.
